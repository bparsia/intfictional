/* Nested choices can be very handy and quick for pounding
out a tree like story which doesn't get very deep and

start text!

Behind you, the room is warm and its scent is familiar.

* [I am uncertain.]

You step over the threshold.
Warm sun heats your back. A light breeze cools your nose. The scents are unfamiliar.

You retreat to your familiar domain.

* [I am comforted.] 
You sit and wash yourself.
    // Since this choice is more like a reveal, we leave it

    You sit and contemplate this new view.
